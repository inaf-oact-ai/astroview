<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p>
    <strong>AstroView</strong> – an application for creating, editing, and viewing datasets consisting of FITS images. When a working Caesar API is available, the application allows you to perform functions such as UMAP, HDBSCAN, Outlier Finder, Similarity Search, and Morphology Classifier on the datasets. The results of these functions can be visualized in the PixPlot application, which enables viewing a large number of images in a 2D plane.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Caesar API</strong> – a set of computational functions, including AI-based methods, that enables analysis and classification of FITS images. <a href="https://github.com/SKA-INAF/caesar-rest">Project link</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PixPlot</strong> – an application for visualizing tens of thousands of images in a 2D plane. <a href="https://github.com/pleonard212/pix-plot">Project link</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Dataset</strong> – a collection of FITS images that includes features, labels, metadata, display modes, and the results of Caesar API functions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Features</strong> – an array of numerical values calculated using various algorithms, including machine learning methods. For the application to function properly, each image must be assigned its own array of features. Features can be imported from a Caesar Dataset JSON file. If such a file is not available, the application can generate random features. <strong>Features Count</strong> refers to the number of values in the array, usually a power of two – 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, etc.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Labels</strong> – alphanumeric values used to group images by different characteristics. Labels can include a numerical value indicating the percentage probability for a given image. An image can have multiple labels.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Metadata</strong> – additional information about the image, which may include fields such as telescope, project, study name, galactic coordinates, image size, and more.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Display Mode</strong> – a set of PNG images generated by converting FITS files using specific parameters such as MinMax, ZScale, Contrast, and others. The application cannot display FITS files directly, so at least one display mode must be added to view the dataset. Each display mode generates its own instance of PixPlot and a Caesar Dataset.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Caesar Dataset</strong> – a JSON file that describes the dataset in a specific structure. This structure is used in Caesar API requests and responses. A Caesar Dataset may contain features, labels, metadata, and other fields. AstroView datasets can be created from Caesar Datasets and vice versa.
</p>

<h2>Navigation Menu</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Datasets</strong> – a list of datasets. Here you can view the entire list of datasets, search for a specific one by name, and create a new dataset.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Library</strong> – allows you to browse the folder containing FITS files.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Storage</strong> – allows you to browse the folder containing the application's service files. This folder includes PNG images of datasets, JSON files in the Caesar Dataset format, and results from Caesar API functions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Labels</strong> – label management page. Allows you to create new labels, rename them, and assign colors.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Users</strong> – user management page. Allows you to create new users, block them, and set passwords.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Jobs</strong> – background task management page. Allows you to view task execution logs and restart tasks if necessary.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Help</strong> – user manual.
